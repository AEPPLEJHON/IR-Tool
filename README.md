IR Measurement Tool designed for Android - Runs on Kivy.
Can run on PC using Python Intepreter by running main.py (all .py files required).

PLEASE NOTE:
Be sure to choose a compatible sample-rate.
Default android sample-rate is 44100 Hz.
If sweep is skipping samples the solution is often to just do another measurement - most likely an internal memory issue.
